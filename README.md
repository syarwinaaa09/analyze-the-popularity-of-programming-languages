# 📊 Project Report: Analyzing the Popularity of Programming Languages

## 🔍 **Introduction**
This project explores the trends in the popularity of programming languages using Stack Overflow data. Key objectives include:
1. 📈 Understanding the growth of the R programming language over time.
2. 🧮 Calculating the percentage of R-related questions in 2020.
3. 🏆 Identifying the top five most popular programming language tags from 2015 to 2020.

I utilized R libraries like `dplyr`, `readr`, and `ggplot2` for data analysis and visualization.
